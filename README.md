# **üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using NSL-KDD Dataset**

## **üìò Overview**

This project implements a Machine Learning‚Äìbased Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the NSL-KDD dataset. The system detects and classifies network connections as normal or attack.
It combines data preprocessing, Random Forest classification, and two user interfaces ‚Äî a Tkinter-based GUI and a Streamlit web app.

## üéØ Project Motivation  
With the growing number of cyber attacks, intrusion detection has become a critical part of modern network security.  
This project aims to create an efficient and lightweight **Intrusion Detection System** using Machine Learning to help classify malicious network activities accurately.

---
## üìÇ Dataset Description  
The **NSL-KDD dataset** is an improved version of the original KDD‚Äô99 dataset used for intrusion detection.  
It contains labeled network connection records categorized as:  
- **Normal**  
- **DoS (Denial of Service)**  
- **Probe**  
- **R2L (Remote to Local)**  
- **U2R (User to Root)**  
Each record includes 41 features representing network attributes such as protocol type, service, flag, bytes transferred, etc.

---
## üß∞ Troubleshooting  
- Ensure all `.pkl` files are in the same directory as the Python scripts.  
- If Streamlit throws a ‚Äúfile not found‚Äù error, re-run `train_model.py` to regenerate the model.  
- For Tkinter GUI issues, verify that Python‚Äôs `tkinter` module is properly installed.

The model performed consistently well across multiple classes and showed balanced precision and recall, making it suitable for IDS use cases.

| Train model | `python train_model.py` |
| Run GUI | `python idu_gui.py` |
